Well, it's finally here. I'm writing the very first post of my new blog! This is a highly anticipated moment (at least by me). It's been a long time coming.

Almost 26 years, as a matter of fact. OK, maybe not my whole life... But's it's certainly long overdue.

I've been dabbling around with the idea of creating a blog for many years now. I must have had the itch to do so around junior year of college or so. I saw other people on the internet documenting some of their thoughts and experiences in the world of software engineering, and I was just starting to grasp the concept and the importance of the personal brand, as I was starting to look for summer internships in the USA.

I had also just had the chance to meet Deepak Daswani at the first edition of the Deloitte Summer Xperience (a weeklong summer camp of sorts for soon-to-be graduates of different fields to experience what it's like to become a business consultant at Deloitte and learn more about its different departments and projects). The one thing I learned that week is that I wanted to stay away from anything consulting related. But I also got some inspiration from Deepak and the stories he shared with us. It sparked my interest in cybersecurity (a field I knew close to nothing about) and got me thinking about starting a blog in which I could document my learnings, projects and experiences. After a couple failed attempts (failed because I quickly abandoned the idea every time I got started, for whatever reason), I ended up never following through with my initial intention.

Now, as a much wiser (albeit still infinitely ignorant) young man, I see so many more benefits to creating this blog and putting out content consistently. Hence, here I am writing these words right now. I will be sharing many of the reasons why I failed in this project of creating a blog and a personal brand, as well as all those benefits I see in them, together with technical posts of different kinds.

In fact, I envision a series of different sub-themes inside this blog. A series on general engineering topics and mindsets, a series on software engineering, a series on my journey to learn cybersecurity, a series on blockchain/crypto... But that's still in the future. For now, I will focus on taking it one post at a time and making sure I learn from my past mistakes.

I'm excited to embark on this journey and I hope you join me and are able to find some value in it.

So, without further ado,

```Hello, world!```
